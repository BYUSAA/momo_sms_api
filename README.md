# Building and Securing a REST API

## Project Overview
This project implements a secure REST API for processing Mobile Money (MoMo) SMS transaction data.
The system parses SMS records from XML, stores them as JSON, exposes CRUD endpoints, and secures access
using Basic Authentication. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are used to demonstrate efficient search techniques.
