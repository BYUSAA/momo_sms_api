# 📘 Building and Securing a REST API for MoMo SMS Transactions

## Project Overview
This project implements a **secure REST API** for managing Mobile Money (MoMo) SMS transactions. It parses SMS data from an XML dataset, converts it into JSON, and exposes it via a **RESTful API** built using **plain Python (`http.server`)**.

The API supports **full CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and is protected using **Basic Authentication**. The project also integrates **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to demonstrate efficient search techniques and compare performance between linear search and dictionary-based lookup.

This system is designed to provide **real-world experience** in API design, authentication, data processing, and algorithmic optimization.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Parse XML to JSON
```bash
python dsa/parser.py
```
This converts `modified_sms_v2.xml` into `transactions.json`.

### 2. Start the API Server
```bash
python api/server.py
```
The server runs at: `http://localhost:8000`

---

## Authentication
All endpoints require **Basic Authentication**.

**Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password123`

Unauthorized requests return:
```
401 Unauthorized
```

> ⚠️ Note: Basic Authentication is suitable for learning but not recommended for production. JWT or OAuth2 are more secure alternatives.

## API Endpoints

__________________________________________________________________
| Method | Endpoint           | Description                      |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| GET    | /transactions      | Get all transactions             |
| GET    | /transactions/{id} | Get a specific transaction by ID |
| POST   | /transactions      | Add a new transaction            |
| PUT    | /transactions/{id} | Update an existing transaction   |
| DELETE | /transactions/{id} | Delete a transaction             |
__________________________________________________________________

All requests must include valid authentication headers.

## Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

### Linear Search
- Iterates through the list of transactions  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)

### Dictionary Lookup
- Maps ID → transaction for direct access  
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) average case

### Performance Comparison
The `performance.py` script compares execution times for **linear search** and **dictionary lookup**, demonstrating the efficiency of hash-based structures for fast retrieval in large datasets.

---

## Security Considerations
- **Basic Authentication** is simple but insecure for production: credentials are sent with every request.  
- For production systems, consider:  
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication  
  - **OAuth2** for secure authorization

---

## Testing
Endpoints were tested using **Postman** and **curl**.  
Screenshots of tests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and Unauthorized requests) are included in the `screenshots/` folder.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates:
- Practical API development using Python  
- Securing endpoints with authentication  
- Efficient data retrieval with DSA techniques  
- Documentation and testing best practices

It is suitable for academic submission, portfolio demonstration, and learning real-world API design.
